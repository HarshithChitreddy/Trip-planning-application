# Images Directory

### Your about images go here!

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically uploads and deploys your team images! When you create a release or pull request, these images will be made available from CS Department servers.

We have strict requirements for this directory's structure as well as the format the pictures may be in.

Structure requirements:

- `About/`
    - `README.md`
    - `header.jpg`
        - This is the team image shown on the top of your team's about page.
        - We require this image to be a JPEG, with a 1920x1080 resolution.
    - `members`
        - `<team member 1's netID>.jpg`
        - `<team member 2's netID>.jpg`
        - `<team member 3's netID>.jpg`
        - `<team member 4's netID>.jpg`
        - `<team member 5's netID>.jpg`
        - etc. 
            - These profile pictures are required to be JPEGs, with a 512x512 resolution.


Consider using [GIMP!](https://www.gimp.org/) GIMP is an open-source Photoshop-like tool for image manipulation. You can resize images by selecting *Image > Scale Image* and crop to our ratios by selecting *Image > Canvas Size*. To export to JPEG, choose *File > Export As...*.
